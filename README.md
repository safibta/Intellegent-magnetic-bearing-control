# Intellegent-magnetic-bearing-control

This solo course project involved solving a bearing slippage issue in an autonomous underwater vehicle. The magnetic bearing in the thruster mechanism of the vehicle would slip due to the water drag. The task was to reengage the thruster each time it slipped. To solve this problem, Hall effect sensors and the servo motor were interfaced with an Arduino using Wolfram Mathematica and System Modeler. 

Here's the diagram from System Modeler circuit:

Here's the block diagram of the feedback loop:
